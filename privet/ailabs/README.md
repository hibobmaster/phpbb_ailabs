## Requirements
* php >=7.4
* phpbb >= 3.2

## Important notes

* Installing of [Simple mentions phpBB extension](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/simple_mentions/) strongly suggested.  
  [@mention]() feature makes it really easy to talk to AI bots and other board users.

* If you are planning to use image generation AI (eg DALL-E or Stable Diffusion) make sure to adjust attachment settings to support large images and verify that `webp` image extension configured.  

  Go to `ACP` > `General` > `Attachment settings` and adjust `Total attachment quota`, `Maximum file size` and `Maximum file size messaging`:
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/attachment_settings.png)  

  Go to `ACP` > `Posting` > `Manage attachment extensions`, look for `webp`, add it if missing:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/attachment_webp.png)  

  Above does not apply to Midjourney, as all generated images are actually stored on your Discord account and served via the Discord CDN.

* If you have extensions installed that require users to log in, such as [Login Required](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/login_required) you will need to whitelist `/ailabs/*` and `/app.php/ailabs/*` since AI Labs extension uses callbacks.

* Adjust [PHP configuration](https://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php) to allow longer script execution. ChatGPT API responses may take up to 90 seconds to respond in certain cases. If you have the default settings, your SQL connection will be closed after 30 seconds, preventing the extension from functioning properly.  
  Suggested values for `php.ini`:  
  > max_execution_time = 180  
  > max_input_time = 90  

## Installation

Download https://github.com/privet-fun/phpbb_ailabs and copy `/privet/ailabs` to `phppp/ext` folder:  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/ext_location.png) 

If you have a previous version of this extension installed, you will need to disable it and then enable it again after the new version has been copied over.  

Go to `ACP` > `Customise` > `Manage extensions` and enable the `AI Labs` extension.

Finally go to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add desired AI configurations:
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/ailabs_settings.png) 

## Midjourney setup 

*  You'll need Midjourney Discord and useapi.net accounts with active subscriptions.   
   Follow instructions at https://www.useapi.net/docs/start-here to setup and verify both.     

* Create new board user who will act as AI bot, for our example we will use user `Midjourney`.  
  Make sure this user account is activated and fully functional.  

* Got to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add new configuration, select `midjourney` from AI dropdown:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/midjourney_setup.png)  
  
  - Use `Load default configuration/template` to get defaults.  
    Replace Configuration JSON `api-key`, `discord`, `server` and `channel` with your values.  
  - Select forums where you want `Midjourney` AI user to reply to new posts and/or to quoted and [@mention](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/simple_mentions) (if you are using Simple mentions extension) posts. 

* Save changes, navigate to forum configured above and create new post (if you configured `Reply on a post`) or quote/[@mention]() `Midjourney` user:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/midjourney_example.png)

* Images generated by Midjourney Discord bot via useapi.net stored and served from Discord CDN.  

## ChatGPT setup 

*  You will need OpenAI account, sign up at https://platform.openai.com/.  
   To obtain API key go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys, click on `Create new secret key`, copy and save in a safe place generated API key.  
   Open AI key starts with `sk-` and look something like this `sk-rb5yW9j6Nm2kP3Fhe7CPzT1QczwDZ5LvnlBfYU2EoqyX1dWs`.  

* Create new board user who will act as AI bot, for our example we will use user `ChatGPT`.  
  Make sure this user account is activated and fully functional.  

* Got to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add new configuration, select `chatgpt` from AI dropdown:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/chatgpt_setup.png)  
  
  - Use `Load default configuration/template` to get defaults.  
    Replace Configuration JSON `api-key` with your Open AI key.  
  - Select forums where you want `ChatGPT` AI user to reply to new posts and/or to quoted and [@mention](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/simple_mentions) (if you are using Simple mentions extension) posts. 

* Save changes, navigate to forum configured above and create new post (if you configured `Reply on a post`) or quote/[@mention]() `ChatGPT` user:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/chatgpt_example.png)

* Fine-tuning can be done by adjusting following OpenAI API chat parameters https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat
  - `model`, default `gpt-3.5-turbo`, full list of models available at https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
  - `temperature`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` - see https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create

* Additional setting used by ChatGPT AI 
  - `message_tokens`, default 4096, limit maximum size of the entire conversation thread  
  - `max_tokens`, default 1024, define size reserved for AI reply when quoted  
  - `prefix`, default empty, can be used to prompt model  
  - `prefix_tokens`, default 0, copy above `prefix` to https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer to get size of your `prefix` in tokens and update `prefix_tokens` with number returned by tokenizer  
  - `max_quote_length`, if provided, the quoted response text will be truncated to the number of words defined by the max_quote_length value. Set it to 0 to remove all quoted text entirely.  

## ChatGPT advanced setup 

You can setup ChatGPT to pretend it is somebody else.  
Let's create new board user `Bender` and configure as shown below:  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/chatgpt_bender_example.png)  
Notice we used `prefix` and `prefix_tokens` to fine-tune ChatGPT AI behaviour.    
Our AI bot `Bender` will provide responses like [this](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=2799), mostly staying in a character.  
  
## DALL-E setup 

Setup mostly the same as for ChatGPT above:  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/dalle_setup.png)    

Refer to https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create to learn more about `n` and `size` parameters.  
[Examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?p=355594)

## DALL-E advanced features

 * To generate an image of the desired size, you can specify one of the following sizes anywhere within the prompt, [example](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?p=355600#p355600):  
   - 1024x1024  
   - 512x512  
   - 256x256  

 * To create [variations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create-variation) of the image simply post image url to the prompt, [example](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?p=355596#p355596)

## Stable Diffusion setup 

*  You will need Stability AI account, follow official instructions https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication to create account and obtain API key.  

* Create new board user, let's say `Stable Diffusion` and create configuration:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/stablediffusion_setup.png)     
  [Examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=2801)  

* Refer to https://api.stability.ai/docs#tag/v1generation/operation/textToImage to learn more about configuration JSON parameters.  

## Troubleshooting
AI Labs extension maintains internal logs, you should have admin or moderator rights to see log icon:  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/debugging_post_icon.png)  

You can see entire AI communication history in the log:  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/debugging_log.png)  
If Log entry is empty it ususally means that `/ailabs/*` or `/app.php/ailabs/*` routes blocked by one of phpBB extensions (eg <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/login_required">Login Required</a>) and you will need to add `/ailabs/*` or `/app.php/ailabs/*` to extension whitelist.  
You can examine Log `response` (JSON) to see details for AI response.  
Please feel free to post your quesions or concerns at https://github.com/privet-fun/phpbb_ailabs/issues.
